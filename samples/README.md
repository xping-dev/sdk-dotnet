You can also modify the Web Application to create your own testing targets.|

### ConsoleAppTesting Sample 

`ConsoleAppTesting` has the following features and benefits:

- It runs as a standalone application, which means you don't need to install or configure any other software or tools. You can run it on any machine that has .NET 8.0 or higher installed.
- It retrieves a web address of the web application to validate from the command line argument `--url`, which makes it easy to use and customize. You can provide any valid web address that you want to test, such as https://example.com or https://example.com/?q=query.
- It tests multiple web addresses with the same set of test components, which saves you time and effort. You can register the components for the testing pipeline in the code and reuse them for different web addresses. For example, you can register the `DnsLookup`, `IPAddressAccessibilityCheck`, `HttpRequestSender`, `HttpResponseContentValidator`, and `HttpResponseHeadersValidator` components to test the response content and status code of the web addresses.
- It verifies if the web application is up and running after deployment, which ensures the quality and reliability of your product. You can set the expected response content and status code in the code and compare them with the actual response from the web address. For example, you can set the expected response content to `"Welcome to Xping"` and the expected response status code to `200` and check if they match the actual response from the web address.
- It warms up the web application by hitting different routes, which improves the performance and user experience of your product right after deployment. You can provide web addresses with different paths that access different parts of your web application and make sure they are loaded and ready to use. For example, you can provide web addresses like https://example.com/home, https://example.com/about, and https://example.com/contact.
