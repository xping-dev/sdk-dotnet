/// <summary>
/// The TestAgent class is the main class that performs the testing logic of the Xping SDK. It runs test components, 
/// for example, action or validation steps, such as DnsLookup, IPAddressAccessibilityCheck, etc., using the HTTP client 
/// and the headless browser. It also creates a test session object that summarizes the outcome of the test operations.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The TestAgent class performs the core testing logic of the Xping SDK. It has two methods that can execute test 
/// components that have been added to a container: <see cref="RunAsync(Uri, TestSettings, CancellationToken)"/> and 
/// <see cref="ProbeAsync(Uri, TestSettings, CancellationToken)"/>. The former executes the test components and 
/// creates a test session that summarizes the test operations. The latter serves as a quick check to ensure that the 
/// test components are properly configured and do not cause any errors. The TestAgent class collects various data 
/// related to the test execution. It constructs a <see cref="TestSession"/> object that represents the outcome of the 
/// test operations, which can be serialized, analyzed, or compared. The TestAgent class can be configured with various 
/// settings, such as the timeout, using the <see cref="TestSettings"/> class.
/// <para>
/// <note type="important">
/// Please note that the TestAgent class is designed to be used with a dependency injection system and should not be 
/// instantiated by the user directly. Instead, the user should register the TestAgent class in the dependency injection 
/// container using one of the supported methods, such as the 
/// <see cref="DependencyInjection.DependencyInjectionExtension.AddTestAgent(IServiceCollection)"/> extension method for 
/// the IServiceCollection interface. This way, the TestAgent class can be resolved and injected into other classes that 
/// depend on it.
/// </note>
/// <example>
/// <code>
/// Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
///     .ConfigureServices((services) =>
///     {
///         services.AddHttpClientFactory();
