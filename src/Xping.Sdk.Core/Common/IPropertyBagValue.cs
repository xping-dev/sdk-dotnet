/// <see cref="NonSerializable{TValue}"/>. The former is a serializable value that implements ISerializable and can be 
/// serialized by compatible serializers. The latter is a non-serializable value that is ignored by the serialization 
/// process. Its main function is to store data during the <see cref="PropertyBag{TValue}"/> lifecycle and to transfer
