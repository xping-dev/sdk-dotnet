/// The DnsLookup class is a concrete implementation of the <see cref="TestComponent"/> class that is used to perform 
/// a DNS lookup. It uses the mechanisms provided by the operating system to perform DNS lookups. 
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <note>
/// This component operates without any dependency on other components. Please also note, the DNS lookup method may use 
/// cached data from the local machine if the DNS information for the host has been cached previously.
/// </note>
/// The DnsLookup mechanism works by sending a query to a DNS server and receiving a response that contains the IP 
/// address of the requested domain name. The query can be either recursive or iterative, depending on the configuration 
/// of the DNS server. A recursive query instructs the DNS server to return the final answer or an error, while an 
/// iterative query instructs the DNS server to return the best answer it has or a referral to another DNS server. 
/// The DnsLookup component uses the mechanisms provided by the operating system to perform DNS lookups. This means that 
/// it can handle both iterative and recursive queries, depending on the configuration of the DNS server. The DNS lookup
/// method can also follow the referrals until it reaches the authoritative DNS server that has the definitive answer. 
/// However, the component does not expose any option to specify the query type or the DNS server to use.
